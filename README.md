This branch is for my own notes related to git.

I think there's an over-reliance on IDE's such as Rider and VS doing all my git commands for me and I'd like to fully understand what's going on under the hood.

Basics

echo "# docker" >> README.md <br />
git init <br />
git add README.md <br />
git commit -m "first commit" <br />
git branch -M main <br />
git remote add origin https://github.com/thatstatsguy/docker.git <br />
git push -u origin main <br />
