This branch is for my own notes related to git.

I think there's an over-reliance on IDE's such as Rider and VS doing all my git commands for me and I'd like to fully understand what's going on under the hood.

Basics
```
echo "# docker" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/thatstatsguy/docker.git
git push -u origin main
```
